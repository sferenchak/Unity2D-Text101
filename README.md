A repository to keep my Text101 files that were created during the Complete C# Unity Developer 2D: Learn to Code Making Games course on Udemy

## Noob Adventure Online
This is a simple text-based choose your own adventure style game built in Unity as part of the above mentioned course. It's fairly rudimentary, but takes advantage of:
* Canvas
* ScriptableObjects to manage state
* SerializedFields that allow for setting variable values from within the Unity Editor
* Basic Sprites
* Text
* TextMeshPro - Text
