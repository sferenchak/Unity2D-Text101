  storyText: "You start charging your sword skill. As the boar gets close, you bring
    your sword down rapidly and the meat of your blade slashes into the top of its
    skull. The approach of the boar stops and after a split second, the boar shatters
    into a bunch of glittering shards of light that slowly fade out of existence.
    You gain barely enough experience points to move your experience bar a visible
    amount. Maybe there is a quest in the village that can be performed that may provide
    more experience.\r\n\r\nWhat will you do?\r\n\r\n1. Head over to the village to
    check things out.\r\n\r\n2. Attack another wild boar."
