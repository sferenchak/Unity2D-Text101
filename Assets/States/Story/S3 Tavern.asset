  storyText: "Upon entering the tavern you see many patrons around the room drinking
    and participating in jovial conversations in small groups. One particular patron
    catches your eye though. It's a small woman that is off in the corner by herself
    at a table that looks rather distraught.\r\n\r\nWhat would you like to do?\r\n\r\n1.
    Go talk to the distraught woman.\r\n\r\n2. Leave the tavern."
