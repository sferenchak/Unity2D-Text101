  storyText: 'You approach the village square. There are a few small buildings that
    look to be small homesteads and a couple of buildings marked with signs. There
    is a sign that looks like a mug of beer. You assume this is some sort of tavern.
    There is a sign in front of another building with what appears to be a shield
    with two crossed swords. This must be the weapon and armor shop.


    Where would you like to go?

    1. Go into the tavern.

    2. Go into the weapon and armor shop.'
