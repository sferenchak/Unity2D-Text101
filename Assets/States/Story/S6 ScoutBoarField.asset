  storyText: "You arrive at the edge of the field of boars. There must be close to
    ten wild boars in this relatively small field. They're mostly grazing and wandering
    around aimlessly. One particular boar catches your eye though. It's larger than
    the rest of them and seems to have a bit of blood and fur on its tusks. That must
    be the one that killed Spot. It's located in the middle of the pack of boars.\r\n\r\nWhat
    would you like to do?\r\n\r\n1. Go straight after the wild boar that killed Spot.\r\n\r\n2.
    Clear out the herd a bit by picking off the other wild boars one by one."
