  storyText: "You ask the woman what's wrong and she responds with, \"I lost my pet
    dog! I was out in the field picking some flowers when a pack of wild boars approached.
    They looked to be very aggressive and territorial and started charging at me.
    My dog, Spot, rushed at them to protect me and I ran away as fast as I could.
    As I was running, I heard Spot yelp and then he went silent. I fear that the boars
    killed him. He gave his life to protect me. Could you go out and avenge Spot for
    me by killing a wild boar? Surely I could reward you.\"\r\n\r\nWould you like
    to help the woman?\r\n\r\n1. Accept the mission to go out avenge Spot.\r\n\r\n2.
    Tell her that you can't really help right now, you have better things to do."
