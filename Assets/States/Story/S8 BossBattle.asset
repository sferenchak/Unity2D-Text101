  storyText: "You begin moving towards the large wild boar while charging up your
    sword skill. At the optimal time, you slash into Spot's killer and see that he
    must be stronger than the other boars. After the first attack, his health bar
    is down to half. You prepare another attack and it appears Spot's killer is charging
    a special attack of its own, called \"Wild Charge.\" You notice that his charge
    time is slightly shorter than yours and you deftly sidestep the attack and unleash
    your own attack just as the wild boar rushes past you, slicing all the way down
    its side.\r\n\r\nSpot's killer is vanquished and shatters into the glittering
    fragments that are becoming oh so familiar to you at this point in your adventure.
    You receive an item called, \"Rough Boar Hide\" after the fragments disappear.\r\n\r\nMaybe
    that can be used for something later. For now, you should return to the distraught
    woman and get your reward.\r\n\r\n1. Return to the distraught woman in the tavern."
