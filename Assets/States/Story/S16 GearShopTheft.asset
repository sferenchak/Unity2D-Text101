  storyText: "You grab a blackened metal greatsword with a decorative hilt off the
    wall. You equip it and see that your attack damage goes up by nearly 100 points.
    Just as you notice your attack damage number increase you feel a sharp pain in
    the small of your back. You hear someone yelling, \"This is what happens to thieves!\"
    and you notice on your heads-up display that your health bar has reached red status
    and the bar continues to slowly deplete. \r\n\r\nPress 1 to continue.\r\n\r\n1.
    Continue to see what happens."
