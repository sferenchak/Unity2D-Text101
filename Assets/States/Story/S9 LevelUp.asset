  storyText: "You're back in the tavern and let the distraught woman know that you
    have avenged her brave dog, Spot. She thanks you profusely and provides you with
    2 silver for your trouble. Upon receiving your reward, you see a flourish of light
    go up around your avatar and hear a triumphant whoosh of sound. You look next
    to the health bar on your heads-up display and see that next to your name is a
    number 2. You have leveled up! You're filled with a strong sense of accomplishment.
    In the real world, you're just a normal guy working at a tech company building
    websites for various businesses, but in this world, you're an accomplished adventurer
    that has just completed your first mission to help one of its citizens. You don't
    know what your next adventure will be, but you're excited to find out.\r\n\r\n1.
