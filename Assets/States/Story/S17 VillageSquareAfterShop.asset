  storyText: "Now back in the village square, you're again greeted with the site of
    some small houses that appear to be living quarters, a tavern, and the gear shop.
    After seeing all of the amazing gear available in shops, you're filled with a
    new determination to start making some coin so you can outfit your character in
    some cool gear. How would one go about earning currency in a game like this though?\r\n\r\nWhere
    would you like to go now?\r\n\r\n1. Go into the tavern.\r\n\r\n2. Head out to
    where you saw the wild boars."
