  storyText: "S20: RushSpotKiller\r\nWith a head of steam, you take off towards the
    larger wild boar. You rush past a couple of boars. As you rush past them, their
    eyes lock onto you and begin to glow an ominous red. You don't even notice because
    you're so intent on getting to the larger wild boar and completing your mission.
    \r\n\r\nAs you close the gap, you start to charge up your sword skill. You reach
    Spot's killer and slam your sword into its side. You see a health bar appear over
    the large wild boar and you see that after your attack it's at half health. Before
    you can even start another attack, you are swarmed by the other wild boars. You
    are hit multiple times from behind. You are hit multiple times from behind.\r\n\r\nPress
    1 to continue.\r\n\r\n1. Continue to see what happens."
