  storyText: 'Welcome to Noob Adventure Online, a text-based adventure game where
    you are a brand new player in the hotly anticipated VRMMORPG, Aldhier Online.
    Your goal is to gain your first level without dying. In this game, death means
    that your character is deleted forever and you''d have to start over.


    At each stage you''ll be asked to make a decision to continue your adventure.
    The number of each choice corresponds to the number on your keyboard. For example,
    to select the first option, press 1 on your keyboard.


    At any point in time, press the ''q'' key to quit.


    Press ''1'' to begin your quest.'
